      <h1> FREEDOM FIGHTERS OF INDIA </h1>

"One individual may die for an idea; but that idea will, after his death, incarnate itself in a thousand lives. That is how the wheel of evolution moves on and the ideas and dreams of one nation are bequeathed to the next." – Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

      <h1> FREEDOM FIGHTERS OF INDIA </h1>
      <p> 
Hundreds and thousands left everything, and many sacrificed their life for one common goal - freedom of India from foreign rule! These freedom fighters, activists and revolutionaries came from different backgrounds and philosophies to fight one common enemy - the foreign imperialists! While we are aware of several freedom fighters and revolutionaries, many have remained unsung heroes. We have made best efforts to present some of the most prominent freedom activists and revolutionaries who made immense contribution towards India’s struggle for freedom.

Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
